# Income Prediction using Logistic Regression and SVM (Kernel) Classifier
## Project Description
In this project, we aim to build and compare two different classifiers, Logistic Regression, and SVM with a Kernel,
for predicting an individual's income category. The models will be trained on a labeled dataset, and their
performance will be evaluated using various metrics, including ROC curves and AUC scores.  

## Methodology
* **Data Preprocessing**: We will start by exploring and cleaning the dataset, handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and performing any necessary feature scaling.

* **Logistic Regression**: We will build a Logistic Regression classifier to predict income levels. The model will be trained on the training dataset and evaluated using various performance metrics.

* **SVM with Kernel** : Next, we will implement an SVM classifier with a Kernel (e.g., Radial Basis Function) to predict income levels. We will train the model on the same training dataset and evaluate its performance.

* **Model Evaluation**: To determine the best-performing model, we will compare the ROC curves and AUC scores of both classifiers. Additionally, other evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score will be considered.
## Tech Stack
* Python Libraries-Matplotlib,seaborn
* Statics-Correlation,Normal Distribution

## Conclusion
The Income Prediction project demonstrates the use of two machine learning algorithms, Logistic Regression and SVM with a Kernel, for predicting an individual's income category. The evaluation metrics and performance comparisons will help us determine the best model for this task.
